# Master Global – Fresh Deploy

This is a clean, fresh deploy package (as if nothing existed before).

## Contents
- index.html
- site.png
- vercel.json

## Deploy (GitHub → Vercel)
1) Open your GitHub repo
2) Delete/replace the old files (especially wrong index.* files)
3) Upload **the extracted files** from this folder (NOT the zip itself) to the repo root
4) Commit → Vercel redeploys automatically.

If you deploy via Vercel upload, upload these three files the same way.
